# MyHealthRecord

My Health Record is Indiaâ€™s first Personal Health Record Management System (PHRMS) designed for citizens to enable them to create and aggregate their clinical and health information for better disease management, thereby leading to a healthier lifestyle. My Health Record, developed by Centre for Development of Advanced Computing and funded by Ministry of Electronics and IT, Government of India, has been designed in compliance to the Electronic Health Record (EHR) Guidelines released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. The PHRMS system also makes use of global healthcare standards such as SNOMED CT for various Personal Health Record (PHR) components such as procedures, laboratory tests and allergies, and RxNorms for including medications as part of the PHR. My Health Record would lead to improved quality of care and efficiency of the healthcare service delivery.
